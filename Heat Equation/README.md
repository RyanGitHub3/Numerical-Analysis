## Heat Equation in the Unit Square
This project demonstrates how the Peaceman-Rachford ADI Method can be used to numerically solve differential equations. The common tool for solving second order ODEs is the Crank-Nicholson Method, however Peaceman-Rachford ADI can improve upon this by leveraging a Tri-Diagonal Matrix solver in order to increase computational speed while preserving accuracy.
