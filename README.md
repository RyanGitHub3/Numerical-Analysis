1. Testing the Gaussian Process for Numerical Integration
- The aim of this project is to determine the integral of a continuous function given only discrete data with noise that is collected at N different steps along the function's interval. A Gaussian Process is used to fit a curve as well as a confidence interval to the data produced from the noisy function, and then the Trapezoidal Rule is used to take the integral of this newly created function, since the curve fitted by the Gaussian Process is discrete.
