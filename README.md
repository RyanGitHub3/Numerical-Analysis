# Numerical-Analysis
This folder contains numerical analysis projects that cover a variety of topics including modeling the Heat Equation, Cubic Spline Interpolation on Predator Prey Relationships, and utililzing a Gaussian Process for curve fitting and to explore numerical integration. The folder will grow as I add more, but the main idea is to explore different numerical methods in a creative manner.
